Overview of Squid::Tasks
========================

Squid::Tasks is a header-only library consisting of several top-level headers within the include directory.

- ```Task.h``` - Task-handles and standard awaiters [REQUIRED]
- ```TaskManager.h``` - Manager that runs and resumes a collection of tasks
- ```TokenList.h``` - Data structure for tracking decentralized state across multiple tasks
- ```FunctionGuard.h``` - Scope guard that calls a function as it leaves scope
- ```TaskFSM.h``` - Finite state machine that implements states using task factories

Sample projects can be found under the @c /samples directory.

Integrating Squid::Tasks
========================

The steps for integrating Squid::Tasks into your game depends on how your game is built:

 * [Integrating Squid::Tasks into an Unreal Engine 4 project](documentation/UE4IntegrationGuide.md)
 * [Integrating Squid::Tasks into an Unreal Engine 5 project](documentation/UE5IntegrationGuide.md)
 * [Integrating Squid::Tasks into a standalone Visual Studio project](documentation/StandaloneIntegrationGuide.md)

Configuring Squid::Tasks with TasksConfig.h
===========================================
The Squid::Tasks library can be configured in a variety of important ways.  This is done by enabling and disabling preprocessor values within the include/TasksConfig.h file:

- **SQUID_ENABLE_TASK_DEBUG**: Enables Task debug callstack tracking and debug names via Task::GetDebugStack() and Task::GetDebugName()
- **SQUID_ENABLE_DOUBLE_PRECISION_TIME**: Switches time representation from 32-bit single-precision floats to 64-bit double-precision floats
- **SQUID_ENABLE_NAMESPACE**: Enables a Squid:: namespace around all classes in the Squid::Tasks library
- **SQUID_USE_EXCEPTIONS**: Enables experimental (largely-untested) exception-handling, and replaces all asserts with runtime_error exceptions
- **SQUID_ENABLE_GLOBAL_TIME**: Enables global time support (alleviating the need to specify a time stream for time-sensitive awaiters) **[see Appendix A for more details]**

An Example First Task
=====================

To get started using Squid::Tasks, the first step is to write and execute your first task from within your project. Many modern C++ game engines feature some sort of "actor" class - a game entity that exists within the scene and is updated each frame. Our example code assume this class exists, but the same principles will apply for projects that are written under a different paradigm.

The first step is to identify an actor class that would benefit from coroutine support, such as an enemy actor. Here is an example Enemy class from a hypothetical 2D game:

```cpp
class Enemy : public Actor
{
public:
	void SetRotation(float in_degrees); // Set the rotation of the enemy
	float GetRotation() const; // Get the rotation of the enemy
	void SetPosition(Vec2f in_pos); // Set the position of the enemy
	Vec2f GetPosition() const; // Get the position of th enemy
	void MoveToward(Vec2f in_pos, float in_speed, float in_dt) const; // Move toward a target position at a given speed
	void FireProjectileAt(Vec2f in_pos); // Fire a simple projectile to a target position
	std::shared_ptr<Player> GetPlayer() const; // Get the location of the player actor
	float GameTime() const; // Get the current game time (in seconds)
	float DeltaTime() const; // Get the current frame's delta-time (in seconds)

	virtual void OnInitialize() override // Automatically called when this enemy enters the scene
	{
		Actor::OnInitialize(); // Call the base Actor function
	}
	virtual void Tick(float in_dt) override // Automatically called every frame
	{
		Actor::Tick(in_dt); // Call the base Actor function
	}
	virtual void OnDestroy() override // Automatically called when this enemy leaves the scene
	{
		Actor::OnDestroy(); // Call the base Actor function
	}
};
```

We want to try writing a simple enemy AI using Squid::Tasks. Conventionally, the ```Tick()``` function would be responsible for performing all AI logic calculations, so we will use that as the entry-point into our first task coroutine. First, we will create a ```TaskManager``` as a private member m_taskMgr. Then, we call ```m_taskMgr.Update()``` from within ```Tick()```.  Lastly, we need to make sure all of tasks stop running as soon as the enemy leaves the scene, so we call ```m_taskMgr.KillAllTasks()``` from within ```OnDestroy()```.

```cpp
class Enemy : public Actor
{
public:
	// ...

	virtual void Tick(float in_dt) override // Automatically called every frame
	{
		Actor::Tick(in_dt); // Call the base Actor function
		m_taskMgr.Update(); // Resume all active tasks once per tick
	}
	virtual void OnDestroy() override // Automatically called when this enemy leaves the scene
	{
		m_taskMgr.KillAllTasks(); // Kill all active tasks when we leave the scene
		Actor::OnDestroy(); // Call the base Actor function
	}

protected:
	TaskManage m_taskMgr;
};
```

Now that we have the task manager hooked up, we can write and run our first task. Let's make our first task very simple, and just have it print out a string and then terminate. To create a task, we simply write a member function with returns type ```Task<>```, and make sure to use at least one co_await or co_return keyword within the function body. This tells the compiler to compile the function as a coroutine with Task<> as the handle type for the coroutine.


```cpp
class Enemy : public Actor
{
public:
	// ...
	
	virtual void OnInitialize() override // Automatically called when this enemy enters the scene
	{
		Actor::OnInitialize(); // Call the base Actor function
		m_taskMgr.RunManaged(ManageEnemyAI()); // Run our task as a fire-and-forget "managed task"
	}

	// ...

	Task<> ManageEnemyAI()
	{
		TASK_NAME(__FUNCTION__); // Gives the task a name for debugging purposes

		printf("Hello, enemy AI!\n");
		co_return; // Return from this task
	}
};
```

With these changes, any enemy instance that enters the scene will print "Hello, enemy AI!". Note that we actually run the task from within ```OnInitialize()```. This line is what actually instantiates the task and tells the task manager to update it every frame.  Now that we have the complete scaffolding in, we can try to write an actual enemy behavior.  Let's try writing a simple chase AI that chases the player if they get too close to the enemy.

```cpp
class Enemy : public Actor
{
public:
	// ...
	
	Task<> ManageEnemyAI()
	{
		TASK_NAME(__FUNCTION__); // Gives the task a name for debugging purposes

		while(true) // This "infinite loop" means this task should run for the enemy's lifetime
		{
			// Wait until player gets within a 100-pixel radius
			co_await WaitUntil([&] {
				return Distance(GetPlayer()->GetPosition(), GetPosition()) < 100.0f;
			});

			// Move toward the player as long as they are within a 100-pixel radius
			while(Distance(GetPlayer()->GetPosition(), GetPosition()) < 100.0f)
			{
				MoveToward(GetPlayer()->GetPosition(), 100.0f, DeltaTime());
				co_await Suspend();
			}

			// Cool-down for 2 seconds before following again
			co_await WaitSeconds(2.0f, GameTime());
		}
	}
};
```

Our chase enemy AI is complete! One advantage of coroutines is that they tend to be fairly straightforward to read, so hopefully you can guess at what some of the above logic means.  Regardless, let's break down how this works.  The first thing we do is create a while(true) loop around our logic.  This is a common coroutine pattern, but it can be confusing the first time you see it.  In a normal function, an infinite loop would result in the thread soft-locking.  However, in coroutines this pattern essentially means "this coroutine will run for the lifetime of the object running it", which is the desired behavior for our enemy AI task.

The next thing we see is the new ```co_await``` keyword. The ```co_await <awaiter>``` expression, when evaluated, will suspend the current task until the awaiter is ready to be resumed again. In this example we use 3 of the most versatile and powerful awaiters in Squid::Tasks:

- Suspend() -> Waits until the next time the task is resumed (usually a single frame)
- WaitSeconds() -> Waits until N seconds have passed in a given time-stream
- WaitUntil() -> Waits until a given function returns true

With these 3 awaiters, it is possible to implement enormously complex state machines with relatively straightforward code. (To learn about the other awaiters that come with Squid::Tasks, refer to the \ref Awaiters documentation.)

Next Steps
==========

Hopefully, this brief tutorial has given you an outline of the steps required to integrate coroutines into your own projects. From here, we recommend exploring the "GeneriQuest" sample project under ```samples/Sample_TextGame```.  It demonstrates both simple and complex applications of coroutines in a simple text-based game example.

This is the end of the tutorial documentation (for now)! If you made it this far, feel free to write to [tim at giantsquidstudios.com] to let us know any ways in which our documentation could have been more useful for you in learning to use Squid::Tasks!

APPENDIX A: Enabling Global Time Support
----------------------------------------

Every game project has its own method of updating and measuring game time.  Most games feature multiple different "time-streams", such as "game time", "real time", "editor time", "paused time", "audio time", etc... Because of this, the Squid::Tasks library requires each time-sensitive awaiter (e.g. ```WaitSeconds()```, ```Timeout()```, etc) to be presented with a time-stream function that returns the current time in the desired time-stream. By convention, these time-streams are passed as functions into the final argument of time-sensitive awaiters.

A final (optional) step of integrating Squid::Tasks is to enable global time support and implement a global Squid::GetTime() function.

For less-complex projects it can be desirable to default to a "global time-stream" that removes the requirement to explicitly pass a time-stream function into time-sensitive awaiters. To enable this functionality, the user must set ```SQUID_ENABLE_GLOBAL_TIME``` in TasksConfig.h and implement a special function called Squid::GetTime(). Failure to define this function will result in a linker error.

The Squid::GetTime() function should return a floating-point value representing the number of seconds since the program started running. Here is an example Squid::GetTime() function implementation from within the ```main.cpp``` file of a sample project:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.cpp
NAMESPACE_SQUID_BEGIN
tTaskTime GetTime()
{
	return (tTaskTime)TimeSystem::GetTime();
}
NAMESPACE_SQUID_END
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is recommended to save off the current time value at the start of each game frame, returning that saved value from within ```Squid::GetTime()```. The reason for this is that, within a single frame, you likely want all of the tasks to behave as if they are updating at the same time. By providing the same exact time value to all Tasks that are resumed within a given update, the software is more likely to behave in a stable and predictable manner.
