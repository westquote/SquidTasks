/// @defgroup FunctionGuard Function Guard
/// @brief Scope guard that calls a function as it leaves scope.
/// @{
/// 
/// A FunctionGuard is an scope guard object that stores a functor that will be called from its destructor. By
/// convention, scope guards are move-only objects that are intended for allocation on the stack, to ensure that certain
/// operations are performed exactly once (when their scope collapses).
/// 
/// Because tasks can be canceled while suspended (and thus do not reach the end of the function), any cleanup code at
/// the end of a task isn't guaranteed to execute. Because FunctionGuard is an RAII object, it gives programmers an
/// opportunity to schedule guaranteed cleanup code, no matter how a task terminates.
/// 
/// Consider the following example of a task that manages a character's "charge attack" in a combat-oriented game:
/// 
/// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
/// 
/// class Character : public Actor
/// {
/// public:
/// 	Task<> ChargeAttackState()
/// 	{
/// 		bool bIsFullyCharged = false;
/// 		if(Input->IsAttackButtonPressed())
/// 		{
/// 			StartCharging(); // Start playing charge effects
/// 			auto stopChargingGuard = MakeFnGuard([&]{
/// 				StopCharging(); // Stop playing charge effects
/// 			});
/// 
/// 			// Wait for N seconds (canceling if button is no longer held)
/// 			bIsFullyCharged = co_await WaitSeconds(chargeTime).CancelIf([&] {
/// 				return !Input->IsAttackButtonPressed();
/// 			});
/// 		} // <-- This is when StopCharging() will be called
/// 		FireShot(bIsFullyCharged);
/// 	}
/// };
/// 
/// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/// 
/// In the above example, we can guarantee that StopCharging will logically be called exactly once for every call to
/// StartCharging(), even the ChargeAttackState() task is killed or canceled. Furthermore, we know that StopCharging()
/// will always be called prior to the call to FireShot().
/// 
/// In practice, it is often desirable to create more domain-specific scope guards for specific use cases, but 
/// FunctionGuard provides a simple general-purpose tool for writing robust, water-tight coroutine logic without the
/// overhead of creating bespoke support classes.
